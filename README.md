# Tableturf-idler
This tool just passes turns continually and then rematches, this will give 40 EXP per go and requires 0 user input, RNG or playing.
## Setup
Just run `npm install`.  
Make a `config.json` by filling in `config-example.json`.  
Run `node .`.  
## Usage
`node .` should be ran while on this screen, this is because this is where the "loop" starts after choosing to rematch:
